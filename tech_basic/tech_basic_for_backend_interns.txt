JSON:

What is JSON? Where is it used? Why JSON?

- JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured
data based on JavaScript object syntax. It is commonly used for transmitting data in web
applications (e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a
web page, or vice versa).
- Data is stored in a set of key-value pairs. This data is human readable, which makes JSON perfect
for manual editing. From this little snippet you can see that keys are wrapped in double quotes,
a colon separates the key and the value, and the value can be of different types. Key-value sets
are separated by a comma.
